## Learning Goals

In this Exercise I'm apply all the following concepts:

Looking at this picture of the page, we can see that there are quite a few styles being applied to this web page. We have background colors for different parts of the page, different background colors, bold font, centered font, and elements being positioned very deliberately with CSS.
